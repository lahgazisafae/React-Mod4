### History & Context 
The history and creation of React starts in 2011 when Facebook realizes theyâ€™re UI is becoming a mess as advertisements become more and more complicated; they come up with React as a solution and expand into react; After it is acquired Instagram wants in, so React must now become open source 2014; it goes through an extensive vetting process involving getting an outside company to implement (Netflix) to prove stability as well as various conferences/workshops before it becomes mainstream in 2016; here we are in 2019 and it is the new flashy thing that will make your developer life easier; (a Chrome Tool for debugging in React was also developed in 2014, can't be legit without a Chrome tool)

### Pain Points of Vanilla JS
--> What was hard about your Mod3 final project? 

- Updating the DOM to reflect changes in your data
- Managing State, keeping track of changes 
- State lives in different places
- difficult to keep the DOM in sync correctly
- How to organize code

Let's focus on the issue of STATE... For example, completing a fetch and trying to use that data throughout your page...
Solutions:
- saving throughout HTML/DOM Nodes
- global variables 
- fetch every time data is needed 

### Visually Organizing with React
- Component Hierarchy
- Draw it out 


### Let's Build!

Now I get to shift the way I visualize building my app thinking of each piece of my page as a separate component, e.g. navbar, card

- let me draw out my UI 
- use that to think about how many components I need
- component nesting/hierarchy


### React Setup

React projects are running on the server development environment provided by node.js
Node Package Manager is a javascript library handler/tool that you can use in terminal (CLI) 
- Download node.js & npm 

' npm create-react-app <name-of-app> ' 

_Important things to note_: While React is giving us a lot of great new functionality, it uses ES6 syntax (for classes) and JSX, not all browsers are compatible with ES6 and JSX must be transpiled to Javascript. Solution: use Babel when we bundle our project before running it on the server! If we set up our project correctly (or use the auto-builder key) it should do this for us with

' npm start '

### How to Learn React 
* How does this tool (or concept) help me problem solve? How can I use this in a way that is efficient?
* How does this make my app more efficient/fast?
